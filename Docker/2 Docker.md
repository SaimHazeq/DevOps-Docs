# DOCKER
APPLICATION: Collection of Service
MONOLITHIC:
Multiple services are deployed on single server with single database.
MICRO SERVICES:
Multiple services are deployed on multiple servers with multiple databases.
BASED ON USERS AND APP COMPLEXITY WE NEED TO SELECT THE ARCHITECTURE.
FACTORS AFFECTING FOR USING MICRO SERVICES:
F-1 : COST
F-2 : MAINTAINANCE
CONTAINERS:
It’s same as a server/vm.
It will not have any operating system.
OS will be on images.
(SERVER=AMI, CONTAINER=IMAGE)
It’s free of cost and can create multiple containers.
DOCKER:
It’s an free & open-source.
It is platform independent.
Used to create, run & deploy applications on containers.
It is introduced on 2013 by solomen hykes & Sebastian phal.
We used GO language to develop the Docker.
Here we write files on YAML.
Before Docker user faced lot of problems, but after Docker there is no issues with the application.
Docker will use host resources (cpu, mem, n/w, os).
Docker can run on any OS but it natively supports Linux distributions.
CONTAINERIZATION:
Process of packing an application with its dependencies.
Ex: PUBG
APP = PUBG & DEPENDENCY = MAPS
APP = CAKE & DEPENDENCY = KNIFE
VIRTUALIZATION:
Able to create resource with our hardware properties.ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS:
Client: it will interact with user
User gives commands and it will be executed by docker client
Deamon: manages the Docker components (images, containers, volumes)
Host: where we install Docker (ex: linux, windows, macOS)
Registry: manages the images.
ARCHITECTURE OF DOCKER:
yum install docker -y #client
systemctl start docker #client, Engine
systemctl status docker
COMMANDS:
docker pull ubuntu : pull ubuntu image
docker images : to see list of images
docker run –it --name cont1 ubuntu : to create a container
-it (interactive) : to go inside a container
cat /etc/os-release : to see os flavor
apt update -y : to update
redhat = yum
ubuntu = apt
Without update we can’t install any pkg in Ubuntu
apt install git -y
apt install apache2 -y
service apache2 start
service apache2 status
docker p q : to exit container
docker ps -a : to list all containers
docker attach cont_name : to go inside container
docker stop cont_name : to stop container
docker start cont_name : to start container
docker pause cont_name : to pause container
docker unpause cont_name : to unpause container
docker inspect cont_name : to get complete info of a container
docker rm cont_name : to delete a container
STOP : will wait to finish all process running inside container
KILL : won’t wait to finish all process running inside containerOS LEVEL OF VIRTUALIZATION:
docker pull ubuntu
docker run -it --name container1 ubuntu
apt update -y
apt install mysql-server apache2 python3 -y
touch file{1..5}
apache -v
mysql-server --version
python3 --version
ls
ctrl p q
docker commit container1 saim:v1
docker run -it --name container saim:v2
apache -v
mysql-server -version
python3 --version
ls
DOCKERFILE:
It is an Automation way to create Image.
Here we use Components to create Image.
In Dockerfile D must be Capital.
Components also capital.
This Dockerfile will be Reusable.
Here we can create image directly without container help.
Name: Dockerfile
docker kill $(docker ps -qa)
docker rm $(docker ps -qa)
docker rmi -f $(docker images -qa)
COMPONENTS:
FROM : used to base image
RUN : used to run Linux commands (During image creation)
CMD : used to run Linux commands (After container creation)
ENTRYPOINT : high priority than CMD
COPY : to copy local files to container
ADD : to copy internet files to container
WORKDIR : to open required directory
LABEL : to add labels for Docker images
ENV : to set environment variables (Inside Container)
ARGS : to pass environment variables (Outside Container)
EXPOSE : to give port numberEX-1:

docker build -t Netflix:v1 .
docker run -it --name netflix1 -p 80:80 netflix:v1
VOLUMES:
It is used to store data inside container.
Volume is a simple directory inside container.
Containers uses host resources (cpu, ram, rom).
Single volume can be shared to multiple containers.
Ex: container-1 (vol1) --> container-2 (vol1) & container-3 (vol1) --> Cont4
At a time we can share single volume to single container only.
METHOD-1:
DOCKER FILE:
FROM ubuntu
Volume [“/volume1”]
docker build -t saim:v1 .
docker run -it --name container1 saim:v1
cd volume1/
touch file{1..5}
cat>file1
ctrl p q
docker run -it --name container1 --volumes-from container1 ubuntu
METHOD-2:
FROM CLI:
docker run -it --name container3 -v volume2 ubuntu
cd volume1/
touch java{1..5}
ctrl p q
docker run -it --name container4 --volumes-from container3 ubuntuMETHOD-3:
VOLUME MOUNTING:
docker volume ls : to list volumes
docker volume create name : to create volume
docker volume inspect volume3 : to get info of volume3
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/volume3/_data
touch python{1..5}
docker run -it --name container5 --mount source=volume3,destination=/volume ubuntu
HOST --> CONTAINER:
cd /root
touch saim{1..5}
docker volume inspect volume4
cp * /var/lib/docker/volumes/volume4/_data
docker attach container6
ls /volume4
DOCKER SYSTEM COMMANDS:
Used to know complete information about the docker elements.
docker system df : to give info of docker objects
docker system df -v
docker inspect container4 | grep -i volume
docker inspect container5 | grep –I volume
docker system prune : to remove unused objects of docker
DOCKER MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
Containers uses our host resources (cpu, mem)
By default we don’t have any limits for containers
We need to set it
docker run -itd --name container1 --memory=”200mb” --cpus=”0.2” ubuntu
docker inspect container1
docker stats
vim Dockerfile

docker run -itd --name dth -p 83:80 dth:v1
docker build -t recharge:v1 .
docker run -itd --name recharge -p 84:80 recharge:v1
docker ps -a -q : to list container id’s
docker kill $(docker ps -a -q) : to kill all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) : to remove all containers
NOTE: In the above process all the containers are managed and created one by one.
In real time we manage all the containers at same time so for that purpose we are going to use
the concept called Docker Compose.
DOCKER COMPOSE:
It’s a tool used to manage multiple containers in single host.
We can create, start, stop, and delete all containers together.
We write container information in a file called Compose file.
Inside the compose file we can give images, ports, and volumes info of containers.
We need to download this tool and use it.
INSTALLATION:
Sudo curl -L “https://github.com/docker/compose/release/download/Vesion/docker-compose-
$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)” -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ls /usr/local/bin/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose version
In Linux majorly you are having two type of commands first one is inbuilt commands which come
with the operating system by default.
Second one is download commands we are going to download with the help of yum, apt, or
amazon linux extras command.
Some commands we can download on binary files.
NOTE: Linux will not give some commands, so to use them we need to download separately.Once a command is downloaded we need to move it to /usr/local/bin because all the userexecuted commands In Linux will store in /usr/local/bin
Executable permission need to execute the command.

By default the docker-compose will support the following names
docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml,
compose.yml, compose.yaml
mv docker-compose.yml saim.yml
docker-compose up -d : throws an error
docker-compose -f saim.yml up -d
docker-compose -f saim.yml ps
docker-compose -f saim.yml down
Images we create on server.
These images will work on only this server.
git (local) --> github (internet) = to access by other
image (local) --> dockerhub (internet) = to access by others
STEPS:
Create DockerHub account
Create a Repository
docker tag container_name user_name/repository_name
docker login --> username & password
docker push user_name/ repository_name
docker tag container_name user_name/ repository_name
docker push user_name/repository_name
docker tag container_name user_name/ repository_name
docker push user_name/repository_name
docker tag container_name user_name/repository_name
docker push user_name/ repository_name
docker rmi -f $(docker image –q)
docker pull user_name/repository_name:latestHigh Availability: More than one server
Why: If one server got deleted than other server will gives the app.
DOCKER SWARM:
It’s an orchestration tool for containers.
Used to manage multiple containers on multiple servers.
Here we create a cluster (group of servers).
In that cluster we can create same container on multiple servers.
Here we have the manager node and worker node.
Manager node’s main purpose is to maintain the container.
Without Docker engine we can’t create the cluster.
Port: 2377
Worker node will join on cluster by using a token.
Manager node will give the token.
SETUP:
Create 3 Servers
Install docker and start the service
yum install docker –y
systemctl start docker
hostnamectl set-hostname Manager
hostnamectl set-hostname Worker-1
hostnamectl set-hostnamce Worker-2
Enable 2377 port
docker swarm init (manager) --> copy-paste the token to worker nodes.
docker node ls
Note: Individual containers are not going to replicate.
If we create a service then only containers will be distributed.
Service: It’s a way of exposing and managing multiple containers.
In service we can create copy of containers.
That container copies will be distributed to all the nodes.
Service --> Containers --> Distributed to nodes
docker service create --name container_name --replicas 3 -p 81:80
saimhazeq/container_name:latest
docker service ls : to list services
docker service inspect movies : to get complete information of service
docker service ps movies : to list the containers of movies
docker service scale movies=10 : to scale in the containers
docker service scale movies=3 : to scale out the containers
docker service rollback movies : to go previous state
docker service logs movies : to see the logs
docker service rm movies : to delete all servicesWhen scale down It follows LIFO pattern.
LIFO = LAST-IN-FIRST-OUT
Note:
If we delete a container it will recreate automatically itself.
It is called as Self-Healing.
CLUSTER ACTIVITIES:
docker swarm leave (worker) : to make node inactive from cluster
To active the node copy the token.
docker node rm node_id (manager) : to delete worker node which is on down state
docker node inspect node_id : to get complete info of worker node
docker swarm join-token (manager) : to generate the token to join
Note:
We can’t delete the node which is ready state.
If we want to join the node to cluster again we need to paste the token on worker node.
DOCKER NETWORKING:
Docker networks are used to make communication between the multiple containers that are
running on same or different docker hosts.
We have different types of docker networks.
Bridge Network : Same Host
Overlay Network : Different Host
Host Network
None Network
Bridge Network:
It is a default network that container will communicate with each other within the same host.
Overlay Network:
Used to communicate containers with each other across the multiple docker hosts.
Host Network:
When you want your container IP and EC2 instance IP same then you use host network.
None Network:
When you don’t want the container to get exposed to the world, we use none network. It will not
provide any network to our container.docker network create network_name : to create a network
docker network rm network_name : to see the list
docker network inspect network_name : to inspect
docker network connect network_name container_id/name
: to connect a container to the network
docker exec -it container1 container_name /bin/bash
apt update
apt install iputils-ping -y : command to install ping checks
ping ip_address of container2
docker network disconnect network_name container_name
: To disconnect from the container
docker network prune : to prune
